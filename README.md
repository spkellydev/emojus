# EmojUs

Full stack javascript application written with React JS, Node, Express and persisted data with MongoDB. This application "shortens" urls by creating an emojified version of the URL. _Note:_ the URL will be a minimum of 20 characters, making it probably the lengthiest URL shortener out there.
